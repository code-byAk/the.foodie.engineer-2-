            <h2>99<span>/</span>PANCAKES</h2>
            <p class="lead">99 Pancakes is a brand and they have a reputation to uphold.
              And they don't disappoint.
              My order:
              ✓ Choco Banoffee Mini Pancakes
              ✓ KitKat Mini Pancakes
              I have to appreciate those KitKat ones. Idk, can you even go wrong with using KitKat in a dessert??🥰 You can feel those KitKat bits bursting in your mouth and that sure gives Foodgasms.
              Frankly speaking, you can skip the Banoffee ones, I like my pancakes chocolaty and don't usually prefer Bananas with them😅
              But if you prefer that way, you must try it.
              You can also try "Chocolate Lovely", their Waffles, and the shakes. Won't really recommend the sides they offer.
              Overall, Jamshedpur can finally boast of a Proper Pancakes Joint.</p>

            <h2>CHINESE<span>/</span>INN</h2>
            <p class="lead">So Chinese Inn was my first stop.
              To say, I have already posted a review of Chinese Inn a year and half back. Now the place is different.
              You got an open sitting option, and more space. And it's post Lockdown obviously.
              Schezwan Pizza should be on your order. And as the name suggests Chinese food is their A1 game.
              I had North Indian on the contrary, and that clearly disappointed. Paneer Butter Masala and Kadhai Paneer were not at their pinnacle.
              But oh that Pizza. 🍕🤤
              I am ready to go to this place only to have that.
              ✓Schezwan Pizza
              ✓Paneer Butter Masala
              ✓Kadhai Paneer
              ✓Tandoori Roti
              Pocket Crunch- ₹1200 for 4
              On a personal note, Chinese Inn has improved their standing during the pandemic. They were serving almost throughout and that has given her loyal customers. But they should look into providing better dine-in services. I had to wait quite some time for my order. And they could not fetch us salad until almost we had finished gulping the food. 🤦🏻 Probably due to reduced man-power😅. Hope for a better Pizza and service on my next visit 😇.</p>

            <h2>FOOD<span>/</span>BOOK</h2>
            <p class="lead">Maggie cravings sorted!
              We randomly jumped in this kiosk after a tedious Bus ride, and if Rats jumping in stomach is an actual saying, Rats were having a a disco party in ours!
              We had more plans, and wanted a quick snack that would just suppress our hunger for the time being. What better than Maggi? 🍝
              FoodBook came into the limelight!
              My order:
              ✓ Vegetable Cheese Maggi 4.5/5
              ✓ Schezwan Vegetable Maggi 4/5
              ✓ Onion Maggi 4/5
              .
              I loved the hygiene of this place.
              The Owner, a sweet lady, she made us feel so welcomed.
              She along with her helper, prepared our order with proper expertise. With every passing minuteb⌛, the oregano aroma was driving us crazy.
              "Just serve it already lady!" 🙆🏻😪</p>
